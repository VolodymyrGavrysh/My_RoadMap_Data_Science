A researcher hypothesizes that electrical stimulation of the lateral habenula will result in a decrease in food intake (in this case, chocolate chips) in rats. Rats undergo stereotaxic surgery and an electrode is implanted in the right lateral habenula. Following a ten day recovery period, rats (kept at 80 percent body weight) are tested for the number of chocolate chips consumed during a 10 minute period of time both with and without electrical stimulation. The testing conditions are counter balanced. Compute the appropriate t-test for the data provided below.

1. What would be the null hypothesis in this study?
2. What would be the alternate hypothesis?
3. What probability level did you choose and why?
4. What were your degrees of freedom?
5. Is there a significant difference between the two testing conditions?
6. Interpret your answer.
7. If you have made an error, would it be a Type I or a Type II error?




In this task you should perform investigation of the transactions dataset of some e-commerce service that provides different kind of **service-packages** and performs on both **desktop** and **mobile**.
